# Description

This print is used to adapt a Unifi Video / Unifi Protect G3 Flex camera to a standard round of hexagonal electrical box. 

The adaptor uses the included surface mount to attach to a box, and in conjunction with the G3 Flex's included panning, ca cover 360 degrees regardless of electrical box orientation. 

The mount is slightly recessed to be as low profile as possible. 

# Print instructions

Print in PLA at temperatures indicated by filament manufacturer or know to work with your printer.

## Orientation

While is is possible to print face-to-bed with supports, this is usually very hard to peel away from a hard bed (glass, AL, basically anything that isn't a spring steel bed surface. 

I have printed my samples vertically, at a 15 degree angle, with very little supports, supports to bed only; this objective is to build enough support to the deeper part of the housing, while allowing the faceplate portion to print without any supports. The ability to print like this is highly dependant on having good bed adhesion, as very little support will be printed relatively to the weight of the finished part. 

In short, try these settings first and go from there: 
* 55 degree support
* Support to buildplate only
* Rotate the access holes to the top of the print
* Block off supports to the camera screw holes

It should look something like this.
